            <h2>So why work with me?</h2>
            <p class="work">With a background in computer science, my superpower is problem solving. I'm excellent at
                breaking down
                weird and wonderful ideas and figuring out how to get them built.
                Having worked independently for years, I'm agile and able to move quickly. I've launched large
                internationaly publicised projects that had to work on day one so I understand the importance of
                reliability and performance.
                Finally, I'm a great communicator and collaborator and understand that you don't always care about *how*
                it gets done, just that it gets done well and on time.</p>

                <p>
                    For over 10 years I've been helping founders & business owners build the technology powering their
                    organisations. I've developed everything from simple marketing websites to entire SAAS platforms and
                    everything in between. With a background in computer science, I'm a problem solver at heart and love
                    taking
                    on complex and challenging projects. I'm great at quickly getting up to speed and breaking down
                    tricky
                    business requirements for industry-specific systems.

                <p>As a full-stack developer, I'm a one-stop-shop, able to take ideas from conception to completion,
                    handling
                    the entire process from start to finish. So whether you're a non-technical founder building your
                    first
                    app
                    or an established enterprise with an existing tech team, I'm ready to jump in and help you get your
                    next
                    big
                    idea off the ground.
