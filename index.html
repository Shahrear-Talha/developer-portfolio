            <h2>So why work with me?</h2>
            <p class="work">With a background in computer science, my superpower is problem solving. I'm excellent at
                breaking down
                weird and wonderful ideas and figuring out how to get them built.
                Having worked independently for years, I'm agile and able to move quickly. I've launched large
                internationaly publicised projects that had to work on day one so I understand the importance of
                reliability and performance.
                Finally, I'm a great communicator and collaborator and understand that you don't always care about *how*
                it gets done, just that it gets done well and on time.</p>
